
Issues- Tkinter doesn't run on Jupyter, However using 
Ai I was able to Change the code to run on Jupyter Labs
Considering I am a beginner coder, The project was ok. 
I remember trying to learn Python Years ago and honestly we Ai 
has made coding easier to understand


Include what was the purpose of your app
	I wanted to build a password generator, and I am still new to coding. 

what you attempted
	I used tkinter, I used an old template from a previous project
	modified some variables

what worked and what didn't work
	Since I used a template most buttons and labels worked
	However, I had to re-write some code to make it work on JupyterHub

what you would still like to do in the future.
	I am intereseted in building a better GUI, but I was told 
	Java is better 
	
 Also what did you learn?
	Python is not great for building GUI's but it is 
	good for data scraping, sorting, and DB creation.
	Going into CySec I would have to learn Scripting, however
	I think learning some code and Ai is the Fast Way 
	to learn it.
